Authentication: 

1. Hashing -> 

What is Hashing?
- Hashing is the process of converting data (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, 
typically a hexadecimal number, using a hash function.

- Hash functions are one-way functions, meaning that it’s computationally infeasible to reverse the 
hash back to the original input.

- Common Hashing Algorithms
1.  SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm): Commonly used for cryptographic purposes.
2.  bcrypt: A hashing function specifically designed for password hashing. It incorporates a salt and 
is slow by design to mitigate brute-force attacks.

- Salting
Salt is a random value added to the password before hashing. It ensures that the same passwords will 
have different hashes, making precomputed attacks like rainbow tables ineffective.
Each password should have a unique salt, which is stored alongside the hash.

How to Implement Password Hashing?
- Hash the Password:
Generate a random salt.
Hash the password combined with the salt using a hashing algorithm like bcrypt.
Store both the hash and the salt in the database.

- Verify the Password:
Retrieve the hash and salt from the database.
Combine the input password with the stored salt.
Hash the combined value.
Compare the resulting hash with the stored hash. If they match, the password is correct.

code Snippet for hashing password 

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const saltRounds = 10;

// Hashing the password
const hashPassword = async (password) => {
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(saltRounds);
  const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
  return hash;
};

// Verifying the password
const verifyPassword = async (password, hash) => {
  const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
  return match;
};

// Usage
(async () => {
  const password = 'mySecurePassword';
  const hash = await hashPassword(password);
  
  console.log('Hashed password:', hash);

  const isValid = await verifyPassword('mySecurePassword', hash);
  console.log('Password is valid:', isValid);
})();

 2. Encryption 

 Encryption is a critical aspect of securing sensitive data, such as user credentials, financial information, 
 and personal details, during authentication processes. Unlike hashing, which is one-way and irreversible, 
 encryption allows for the transformation of data into a secure format that can be decrypted back to its original 
 form using a specific key.

 What is Encryption?
- Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using an 
encryption algorithm and a key.
- Decryption is the reverse process, converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the corresponding decryption key.

 Types of Encryption
- Symmetric Encryption: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It's faster but requires secure key 
management since anyone with the key can decrypt the data.
Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

- Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys—one for encryption (public key) and one for decryption (private key). 
It is more secure for key exchange but slower than symmetric encryption.
Example: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).

 When to Use Encryption in Authentication?
- Sensitive Data Storage: Encrypt sensitive data that needs to be retrieved in its original form, such as API keys, 
session tokens, or payment details.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS): Ensure all data transmitted between clients and servers is encrypted to prevent 
interception by attackers (man-in-the-middle attacks).
- Encrypting User Data: For scenarios where user data, such as security answers, must be stored securely and retrieved.

 Best Practices for Encryption in Authentication
- Use Strong Encryption Algorithms: Avoid deprecated algorithms (e.g., DES, MD5) and use modern, secure algorithms like 
AES for symmetric encryption and RSA for asymmetric encryption.
- Key Management: Securely manage and store encryption keys using tools like hardware security modules (HSMs), cloud key 
management services, or environment variables.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS): Always use TLS (HTTPS) to encrypt data in transit between clients and servers.
- Data Encryption at Rest: Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases, files, or backups to protect against data breaches.
- Rotate Keys Regularly: Implement key rotation policies to minimize the risk of key compromise.
- Limit Encryption Scope: Encrypt only the necessary data to minimize performance impact while maintaining security.

3. JSON Web Token (JWT) - 
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a popular method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in modern web applications. They enable stateless authentication, where the server doesn’t need to store session data because the JWT itself contains all the necessary information.

1. What is a JWT?
Structure: A JWT consists of three parts:

Header: Contains the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HS256).
Payload: Contains the claims or data you want to transmit (e.g., user ID, roles).
Signature: Verifies the authenticity of the token, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with.
Format: JWTs are base64-encoded strings, formatted as header.payload.signature.

Header:
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Payload:
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}

Signature: Created using the header, payload, and a secret key.

3. How JWT Works in Authentication
- User Login: When a user logs in, the server authenticates the credentials. If valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.
- Token Storage: The client stores the JWT, usually in local storage or cookies.
- Authenticated Requests: For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header (commonly with a Bearer prefix).
- Token Validation: The server verifies the JWT signature and extracts the payload to validate the user's identity and permissions.

Code Snippet - 

Generate JWT (Login)
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Secret key for signing the JWT
const secretKey = 'your-secret-key';

// Function to generate a JWT
function generateJWT(user) {
  const payload = {
    sub: user.id,
    name: user.name,
    role: user.role
  };
  
  // Sign the JWT with the payload and secret key
  const token = jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  
  return token;
}

// Example usage
const user = { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', role: 'admin' };
const token = generateJWT(user);
console.log('JWT:', token);


Verify JWT (Middleware)
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Middleware to verify JWT
function verifyJWT(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1]; // Extract token from 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).send('Access Denied');
  }

  try {
    // Verify the token with the secret key
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, secretKey);
    req.user = decoded; // Attach the decoded payload to the request object
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid Token');
  }
}

Protect Routes

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Apply the verifyJWT middleware to protect this route
app.get('/protected', verifyJWT, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

4. Local Storage - 

Local Storage is a web storage feature provided by modern browsers that allows web applications to 
store data persistently within the user's browser. Unlike cookies, which are sent to the server 
with every request, data stored in Local Storage remains in the browser and can be accessed by 
client-side scripts.

1. Characteristics of Local Storage
Key-Value Storage: Local Storage stores data as key-value pairs, where both keys and values are strings.
Persistent Storage: Data in Local Storage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, unlike 
session storage, which is cleared when the session ends.
Storage Limit: Local Storage typically offers 5-10MB of storage space per domain, depending on the browser.
Domain-Specific: Data stored in Local Storage is accessible only within the same domain (origin) that stored it.

2. When to Use Local Storage
Storing User Preferences: Ideal for storing settings like theme preferences, language choices, and layout configurations.
Caching Data: Can be used to cache data from an API to reduce network requests and improve performance.
Persisting Form Data: Save form inputs temporarily to avoid data loss if the user accidentally navigates 
away from the page.
Remembering User State: Store non-sensitive information like user session state or application state between 
page reloads.

3. How to Use Local Storage
Set an Item:
localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

Get an Item:
const value = localStorage.getItem('key');
console.log(value);  // Output: value

Remove an Item:\
localStorage.removeItem('key');

Clear All Items:
localStorage.clear();


4. Example Usage
Storing User Preferences:
// Store user theme preference
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

// Retrieve user theme preference
const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
if (theme) {
  document.body.classList.add(theme); // Apply theme to the body
}

Caching API Data:
// Fetch and cache data from an API
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Cache data in Local Storage
    localStorage.setItem('apiData', JSON.stringify(data));
  });

// Retrieve cached data
const cachedData = localStorage.getItem('apiData');
if (cachedData) {
  const data = JSON.parse(cachedData);
  console.log(data); // Use cached data
}

 Alternatives to Local Storage
Session Storage: Similar to Local Storage but the data is cleared when the page session ends (i.e., when the tab or window is closed).
Cookies: Useful for storing small amounts of data that need to be sent to the server with each HTTP request. More suitable for authentication tokens and session management.
IndexedDB: A more advanced, client-side storage solution for handling larger datasets and more complex transactions.
